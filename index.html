            <h2>Hi, I'm Hakim Kamara</h2>
            <p>I am a 4th year Computer Systems major who is also minoring in Studio Art. I plan on graduation this year but with the way these classes are getting to me, this is more of an "I hope" than an "I will". I initially started off with Computer Science but I, as some others might agree, it's a lot more than what I initially expected and switched majors.</p>
            <p>I am a big art fiend and have been drawing realistic portraits since middle school. This passion spawned out of nowhere with this sudden urge to capture the beauty in others and have people see the little details in the world in the same way I do. This growing skillset got me an internship for the San Bernardino County Probation Department as a media specialist where I have been making professional level graphic designs and advertisements.</p>
            <p>Whilst trying to pursue art in my early school years, I was accidentally switched into a piano class and that started another major interest of mine, music. I have been learning new instruments constantly since then and now know how to play 9 different instruments from 5 unique categories. The saxophone, trumpet, and the marimba have been my favorite to play.</p>
